# --------------------
# Remember to:
#   * Capitalize the subject line
#   * Limit the subject line to 50 characters
#   * Use the imperative mood in the subject line
#   * Do not end the subject line with a period
#   * Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   * Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   * Wrap the body at 72 characters
#   * Can use multiple lines with "-" or "*" for bullet points in body

# Example
# Refactor the coupon UI

# Because:
#  - The old UI code is fairly slow
#  - There were a few unused dependencies
#  - The old UI has aged poorly
